Key Findings:

•	The grand total revenue worldwide in the span of 2019-2020 is $ 4,690,319 
•	India was the highest revenue generating country.
•	During the observed period, the month of October recorded the highest number of units sold, consequently resulting in the highest profit for the month.

Analysis and Interpretation:
•	Annual revenue for 2020 is 54% higher than 2019 at 24%.
•	India is the most profitable market, accounting for 23.12% of global sales
•	The increase in annual revenue, profit and volume from 2019 to 2020 can be attributed to the pandemic period when people were stocking up on food.
•	The analysis indicates that the highest monthly sales volume was observed towards the end of the year, owing to seasonal holidays such as Halloween and Christmas.
•	Chocolate Chip Cookie emerged as the best-selling and most profitable product in all countries under consideration, while Fortune Cookie registered the weakest performance. These findings were consistent across all countries, as well as globally.

Conclusions and Recommendations:
•	Our analysis suggests that the Chocolate Chip Cookie is a strong performer and presents an opportunity to further increase sales. As such, we recommend that the company prioritize this product in its future strategies.
•	Our findings indicate that end-of-year holidays such as Christmas and Halloween offer a significant potential for driving sales. Thus, we recommend that the company focus on promotional drives during this period to capitalize on this opportunity.
•	An additional recommendation for the company to maximize sales during the holidays is to introduce holiday-themed bundles and/or offer products with holiday-related packaging.
•	To maintain sales, it is crucial for the company to offer its top-performing product in all countries.
•	To improve sales performance for low-performing products, the company may consider increasing advertising efforts for these products.
